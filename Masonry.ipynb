    "The term masonry covers concrete blocks, bricks, stone work, and even glass block.  To generalize it is any work done where elements are assembled by means of laying with the application of mortar.  Mortar is a mixture of a cementitious product and well-graded sand.  There are a variety types of mortar, and numerous sizes, and styles of blocks, and bricks.  I've shown just a small sample of brick sizes below. You should note that this is actually broken into two tables and both tables are dependant upon the mortor joint size.

It is important to be familiar with terms like Stretcher, Header, Soldier, Sailor, Rowlock and Shiner ([detailed description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brickwork#Orientation)).

This allows for rapid gaining of strength.

In the Summary Of Recommendations they listed following seven points to move the industry towards sustainability.\n",
    "\n",
    ">1. Sustainable design balances environmental, economic and societal goals. It is more than just a certification from a rating system\n",
    ">2. Brick is made from abundant natural resources (clay and shale) and is readily recycled for use in the manufacturing process or other uses\n",
    ">3. Brick manufacturers address sustainability by locating plants in close proximity to mines; incorporating waste products and recycled materials into brick; reducing energy use, water use and atmospheric emissions; and utilizing landfill gas and other wastes for fuel\n",
    ">4. Brickwork used in sustainable designs can provide structure, finish, acoustic comfort, thermal comfort, good indoor air quality, fire resistance, impact resistance and durability, all in one product\n",
    ">5. Brickwork can help meet requirements of many certification rating systems in the areas of development density, storm water management, heat island effect, improved energy performance, building reuse, construction waste management, materials reuse, recycled content and regional materials\n",
    ">6. Brickwork can contribute to improved indoor air quality by eliminating the need for paints and the resulting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and by eliminating a food source for mold\n",
    ">7. Brickwork is durable, having a life expectancy of hundreds of years. Brick buildings can be and are reused, thereby distributing their environmental impact over an extended life span\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these seven, number seven is one of the best arguments for for sustainability.  Reuse of existing structures does effectively reduce their environmental impact.  This argument can also be made for other structures, and as some of you are future contractors, this should be something you should keep in that back of your mind when trying to get a project certified as sustainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The North West Concrete Masonry Association (NWCMA) published a technical note (TEK) on [Concrete Masonry and Sustainable Design are a Natural Fit](http://www.nwcma.org/pdfs/concrete-masony-and-sustainable-design.pdf) in 2010.  In it there were seven points arguing for the sustainable aspects of concrete masonry units on the following topics.\n",

    ">2. Resource Efficiency\n",

    ">6. Aesthetics\n",
    ">7. Enclosure and Finish\n",

    "During the first semester I taught Construction Materials I received a request to discuss mud brick construction.  This was reasonable since it is one of the oldest forms of masonry construction, and, in some parts of the world, it is still in use.  The process of making these types of bricks involves the use of soil mixed with a fibrous material like straw, or loam.  The soil typically contains some sand and silt, but its most important component is clay.  The clay acts as a binder holding the rest of the soil together and it sticks the rest of the material to the straw.  It is important that the type of clay used is not an expansive clay since it would lead to uneven drying and result in cracking (in Florida this is sometimes called shrink-swell clay).  The straw in the brick acts like rebar in concrete; it carries the tension.\n",
    "\n",
    "The soil and straw (and sometimes dung) are mixed together, then formed into brick shapes either with a mold or by hand, then left to dry in the sun for at least two weeks or more.  Once laid into a wall the surface is typically plastered over with mud.  This acts as a sacrificial coating that will protect the bricks when it rains.  This coating needs to be periodically replaced to prevent erosion of the bricks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though a more permanent cementitious coating can be applied, this moisture protection requirement almost uniformly relegates the use of mud bricks to dry climates.  It is also a very labor intensive process and is only cost effective where labor is abundant and cheap and the local clays usable in the making of mud bricks."

Some of these bricks can resist temperatures of up to 3,000 $^\\circ$F.  Chemical resistant brick or [acid brick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_brick) is a type of brick specifically created to resist damage from acids.  It must be laid with the use of a special mortar that does not contain portland cement and the mortar joints are typically much smaller than regular brick construction.

Because concrete blocks are mostly made from portland cement and aggregate there is potential to vary the mixture of the block to obtain different properties.

    "Grout is not the same thing as mortar and the two can not be used interchangeably.  Grout needs to be rather thin (high fluidity) in order to flow into the narrow spaces surrounding the reinforcing steel in masonry walls.  It should have a slump around 8-10 inches to do this.  The strength of grout typically runs between 600 and 2,500 psi though it can exceed this if water is absorbed from it into the surrounding masonry.  \n",

Strength test mortar samples are not cylindrical in shape but rather [small cubes](http://ncma-br.org/pdfs/68/TEK%2018-05B.pdf) measuring 2\" on each side.  Samples may need to be taken if water retention, air content, or even bond strength is specified.  \n",

    "However if the wall strength is specified ($f'_m$) it is more likely that a prism will be used to determine the strength of the wall composite.  A prism is a small built up unit that is made from the masonry units, mortared together and filled with grout.  This whole unit is then tested in compression. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for using a prism, instead of testing the individual components, is that if you test the components you would need to account for the differing Poison's ratios' effect on the strength of the system.  Additionally you would need to account for the bond strengths' contribution to the wall strength.  Finally using a prism incorporates the effect of the mason's skill in assembly.\n",

The reason for this is the same as for unreinforced concrete; as the wall is put into bending one side will develop tension.  Being a brittle material either the bonds between mortar and unit break, or the mortar or units will themselves break.  This leads to the inevitable collapse.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For reinforced masonry it is desirable that the units rather than the mortar fails.  This does not mean using the highest strength mortar available though since the interaction of the Poisson's ratios' of the unit and mortar will have a substantial impact on $f'_m$.  If the mortar strength it too high it will actually fail first due to this interaction.  However if the wall is designed properly there will be substantial yielding of the steel reinforcement and cracking showing before the collapse of a wall."

Moisture infiltration can lead to mold and thus is a form of failure.  \n",

    "A critically important failure mode is caused by the lack of control joints.  These are gaps in walls filled with a flexible material where the sections of a wall can expand or contract from in a controlled manor.  Since brick will expand over time due to moisture absorption and CMUs will contract due to shrinkage of the concrete these gaps are extremely important.  Even the expansion and contraction of a wall due to temperature changes from day to night could cause a continuous wall to tear itself apart.  These control joint are typically from 15 to 25 feet apart and will be closer in walls with openings.  These joints will be both in the vertical and horizontal directions.\n",
