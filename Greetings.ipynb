    "\n",
    "* Firefox - [Thumbnail Zoom Plus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/thumbnail-zoom-plus/?src=search) *(Not all bordered images will have a zoomed version with this extension, but most will.)*\n",

    "\n",
    "Once you install one of those add-ons you should be able to hover your mouse over the cat and see a much larger view.  This is useful in conserving screen space and I will use this technique to provide detailed images that are too big to fit on the screen along side of text descriptions.  Go ahead and install the appropriate addon once I have finished talking and then come back and test it out on this slide.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to that useful feature you should notice that there is a scroll bar on the right side of the screen.  This is the second major difference that between other slide shows and this style.  That scroll bar will appear if the content of the slide is too big to fit on your screen.  In this case I have included the text of what I'm saying to fill up the screen.  I will try to avoid having content that goes past the bottom of the screen but sometimes it will be unavoidable and in those cases it is useful for you to be able to scroll down to the bottom and get the full picture.  \n",

    "### Useful Tip:\n",

    "I recommend viewing these lectures in the browser [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/).  It has had the best ratings passing the [HTML5 Test](http://html5test.com/) (526 out of 555 points) and as such it has been the most compatible and reliable in displaying web content correctly.  I've listed some other popular browser scores below.\n",

    "I have a few more useful tips about the lectures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Firstly, each slide in a slide show has its own unique web address.  As such you can bookmark / favorite a particular slide to be able to come right back to it.  \n",
    "    * Additionally, each heading or title has an associated link with it which allows you to jump right back to a particular point on a slide.  I actually try to limit the number of heading on each slide to one but sometimes there may be something I am trying to call attention to which requires it's own heading. \n",
    "2. Secondly, all the text in a slide show is selectable.  This is particularly useful if you happen to want to copy part of an equation.  \n",
    "3. The third tip you might have already noticed; the audio will auto play whenever you first view a new slide.  The exceptions are the first slide in a slide show, which usually contains a video, and the previous slide in this presentation.  In addition to this any slide that automatically started talking it will automatically stop once you leave it for a different slide.  It will also pickup right where it left off if you come back to it, (as long as you are not re-opening the lecture).\n",
    "4. You will not be able to directly view these lectures in [Canvas](https://ufl.instructure.com/) (UF's course management system).  Once you click a link to a lecture it will open up a page and display the message below.  In order to view the lecture you need to click on the lecture title just below the message and then it should open up a new tab.\n",
    "    * \"You are trying to launch insecure content from within a secure site (canvas). Some web browsers may prevent this content from loading.\"  \n",
    "    \n",
    "5. These slide shows can each be viewed as a single long web page.  These web pages can be found at the [main github site](https://github.com/damontallen/Construction-materials#construction-materials) for this course.  I don't recommend viewing them like this initially since the audio does not automatically play when viewed as a single page and sometimes I will say things that do not appear in writing."
