Recycling aluminum only uses 5% of the energy needed to produce aluminum from bauxite ore. This results in a substantial reduction in greenhouse gases. Additionally, the majority of the aluminum in the world is produced using power from hydroelectric facilities. Though these have an environmental impact of their own, dams are considered a renewable source of power. Currently about 65% of aluminum is recycled in the United States and world wide 35% of all aluminum production comes from recycled material ([source](http://recycling.world-aluminium.org/review/sustainability.html)).  Due to the long life span of most construction projects only about 8% of recycled aluminum is currently coming from construction salvage. \n",

Products like aluminum siding could be reused, but it is difficult to remove it in a reusable condition.  Aluminum wire should not be reused if it has been removed from a structure.  The reason for this is related to fatigue.  Unlike steel, aluminum does not have a lower fatigue limit, and the cycling current in the wire creates enough physical stress in the wire to eventually lead to cracking and failure.  The expand on this, not mater how big the piece of aluminum is, or how small the cycled load is, aluminum will eventually fail due to fatigue.  That is not saying that it cannot be used effectively in construction, but its exposure to repeated loading should be considered when thinking about a particular application.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When examining a fatigue failure in aluminum, part of the surface will be dark where the crack was, and part of it will be bright where the final fracture occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is interesting to note that most commercial aircraft have aluminum skin, and aircraft aluminum skin has failed before due to fatigue. The loading cycle which causes failure, is due to the repeated pressurization and de-pressurization of the aircraft cabin. On a side note, in original airplane design the windows were not round, but rather they were square. This unfortunately lead to [stress concentrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_concentration) at the corners, which in turn lead to accelerated fatigue cracking. Surprisingly the method used to stop the propagation of fatigue cracking, is drilling a hole at the end of the crack. The round hole reduces the level of stress concentration at the tip of the crack, which in turn increases the fatigue lifespan of the remaining material.\n",

These include riveting, stitching, interlocking joints, brazing, soldering, and adhesive bonding.  Various versions of joints made using these techniques are commonly seen in ductwork on construction sites.  The particular joint used depends on the specific application, and the resulting strength required of the joint.  If a particular joint strength is required it may need to be verified, but the verification of the joint strength is, however, outside the scope of this class."

Once the oxide coating damaged, elemental aluminum will be directly exposed to oxygen.  Aluminum is so highly reactive with oxygen, that it is actually used as a propellant in rocket fuel.  The reason why we don't have aluminum cans exploding all the time is because the oxide coating will quickly reform, cutting off the oxygen from the bulk of the aluminum (its only when powdered is aluminum useful as rocket fuel).

    "Aluminum is sold in many shapes and sizes.  It can come in the form of sheets, tubes, extruded parts, and nails among others.  The prices of each of these are dependent on the raw material cost of aluminum, but are also strongly dependent on the working process needed to form the final product.  There is not a good rule of thumb that can be used in estimating prices of aluminum products in this case.  Just as a counter example you might think that aluminum flashing would be more expensive than steel flashing.  On average you might find a roll of aluminum flashing (16\"x50') for \\$51.40, but that is not substantially more than the average price for the same size roll in steel, \\$50.10.  The reason the prices are so close is that less aluminum is necessary to achieve a comparable durability.\n",

The plane suffered explosive decompression when an 18 foot long section of the fuselage separated from the aircraft.  The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that the accident was caused by metal fatigue exacerbated by [crevice corrosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crevice_corrosion). The plane was operated in an environment where it was repeatedly exposed to salt and humidity.  Additionally, a passenger boarding the plane noticed a crack in the fuselage, but failed to report it.  Despite the substantial damage to the aircraft only one person died.\n",
