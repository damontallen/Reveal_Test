    "In a world where population is increasing and emerging third world economies are trying to industrialize we need to concern ourselves with sustainability.  Sustainability is defined as the ability to continue a behavior indefinitely.  To start with one of the big problems that need to be dealt with soon is CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.  In particular, according to the [U.S. Green Building Council](http://www.eesi.org/files/climate.pdf) buildings were responsible for 39% (2236 million metric tons) of total U.S. CO2 emissions in 2004 and they are projected to emit about 20% more this year than they did in 2004.  The main source of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is energy consumption.  With respect to buildings these emissions come from extraction of raw materials, processing, manufacturing, transportation, construction, operation, repair, and finally the building's demolition.  Over the next generation the volume of the built space in the world is expected to double.  \n",

    "Over the a 50 year life cycle of a traditional building, 80% to 85% of the total energy it consumes is its operational energy.  However, as designs are becoming more and more energy efficient the energy that goes in the the creating of the building is becoming a greater portion of that total energy consumption.  This energy that make up that initial embodied energy includes the extraction of raw materials, processing, manufacturing, transportation, and its construction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce the embodied energy of a building several techniques are being employed.  These include the use recycled material, sourcing material locally, and making use of more energy efficient construction practices.  The first two of these are part of what is known as “resource-conscious design” and are central points to sustainable construction.  The general goal of sustainable construction is to minimize the natural resource consumption and the impact on ecological systems.  To do this products are selected that minimize solid, liquid and gaseous waste.  Additionally these products should be easily disassembled at the end of their life, as well as be capable and worth of being recycled.  <a href = \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_building\"><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/El-v-01_ubt.jpeg/360px-El-v-01_ubt.jpeg\" alt = \"Wind turbines image\" Title=\"Green Energy\" style=\"max-width:200px; max-height:200px; border:1px solid blue; float:right; margin-left:10px;\"/></a>Finally the inevitable waste that results should be nontoxic to biological systems.\n",

Although it contains elements of climate-specific aspects it is not solely based on low environmental impact.  This has lead to some builders and designers gaming the rating system to achieve LEED certification which in turn increases the economic gains from a building's sale or rental.  Since energy conservation is expensive, in the past builders have minimized the points from those categories and maximize points from categories like Sustainable Sites, Location and Transportation, Materials and Resources, and Indoor Environmental Quality.
