    "Though reuse is even simpler than recycling, there are a lot potential difficulties with reusing steel.  Though it is not unheard in the automotive industry, in construction it is far less common.  Firstly, finding a specified size or shape, for a new building, may not be possible if you are reusing parts from older structures.\n",
    "\n",

There is a failure mode, that I have not previously mentioned, known as fatigue.  Fatigue is caused by repeated loading of a material, at a level below the yield stress. This repeated loading causes the growth of microfractures, and can eventually lead to a fracture failure.  This is known as the endurance limit and can occur with loading even lower than half the maximum strength (depending on the material), as long as the loading cycle is repeated enough times.  With steel, however, there is a lower limit of loading (the ultimate endurance limit) at which a part can be repeatedly loaded and unloaded, forever, with no risk of fatigue.  The ultimate endurance limit is just found by extrapolating the endurance limit at an infinite number of cycles.  Also, if a part can be reheated or annealed then the atoms of the material surrounding the microfractures can move around enough to reform the previously broken bonds.  Unfortunately, this is a process that is impractical when a part is in place inside a building.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another potential problem with reusing steel is that the part needed may have some type of surface contamination.  This coating would need to be removed prior to using the part in the new application.  There are other concerns as well but I think you get the idea. For these reasons steel is typically recycled rather than reused.  It is not always the case with other construction material, but for metals structural components it happens more often than not."

It is mainly comprised of iron and carbon atoms (a maximum of 2.0% by weight) arranged in a series of interlocking grains formed from metallic crystals.  Steel alloys may contain other elements like tungsten, cobalt, nickel, chromium, manganese and even (more recently) aluminum.  These alloys result in modifications in the strength, stiffness, density, corrosion resistance, hardness, and/or the attraction to magnets among other properties.  There have been thousands of varieties of steel developed to meet specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the construction industry we are mainly interested in the steel used in bars, beams, girders, trusses, fasteners and cables.  These are item used to resist the loads present in structures, and the building construction process.  Most structural steel sections are formed from large castings and are then reduced in size, elongated, and shaped by rolling.  The temperature at which these rollings take place has an effect on the final properties of the element.  As for the chemistry, the structural steel that we concern ourselves with will have carbon content that is generally less than 0.30%.\n",

Welding can create connections that are stronger than are possible using traditional fasteners such as bolts or [rivets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivet).  It also reduces the size of the members at these connections by eliminating the need for overlapping pieces.  Welding allows for the creations of structures that would otherwise be impossible to produce.\n",

    "Lastly, steel is also resistant to combustion.  Not saying that heat does have an effect, it can have a very important effect (discussed later) but in a lot structures, steel does not even need to be protected against fire exposure."

    "As we have seen previously, the ability of steel to resist strain can depend on the amount of strain the steel has previously undergone.  The red curve is more representative of the behavior of an actual sample vs. an what is seen in idealized graph.  The plotted behavior is also called the \"engineering\" stress-strain relationship.  It is called that since it reflects the engineering properties of a particular sample instead of the actual properties.  \n",
    "\n",
    "OK, that isn't really clear.  The engineering stress-strain relationship is typically found by taking a cylindrical sample of the material (steel in this case) and first measuring the cross sectional area of the sample, then applying a tension force to it, and recording the resulting strain.  The stress is calculated by dividing the applied force, by the original cross sectional area of the sample.  This is as apposed to the instantaneous cross section of the sample. Using the instantaneous cross section results in the dark blue line which represents the true stress-strain relationship.\n",

The reason there is a difference between the true and engineering stress-strain curves is due to something called necking.  As tension is applied to a ductile sample it starts to pull apart, like taffy or gum.  This causes a reduction in the diameter of the sample, and a reduction of the instantaneous cross sectional area.  The \"true\" stress-strain curve has its stress calculated by dividing the tension force by the cross sectional area continuously throughout the test.  When the reduction in area is accounted for, then the strength of steel will generally only go up with additional straining.  This is actually one process that is used to create high strength wire.  The steel is drawn through a small dye, and the resulting staining results in a wire that has higher strength than the original steel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the engineering stress-strain curve.  The reason why we look at the engineering curve is that it is representative of the behavior of an installed steel element.  We see that the yield point (#2) is slightly higher that the curve just to the right.  This means that once the yield point is reached, the effective strength of the element drops, and it must immediately strain much more to reach the stain hardening portion of the curve.  This is the reason that idealized curves have a straight line across in the plastic section. If a continuous force is applied to the element it will rapidly lengthen until it starts to strain harden.  This is what you see in the next section of the curve (#4).  The ultimate strength is reached at point #1, if the force remains constant after that the element lengths and fractures.  However if the force is not constant, but rather it is simply a function of displacement (like during testing) then the element will have a reduction in carrying capacity until it reaches point #3, the fracture point.  The section of the curve where the strength is falling (#5) is where the majority of necking occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the idealized engineering stress-strain curve for A36 steel.  The 36 in the designation refers to the $36,000 ksi$ at the yield point on the stress-strain curve.  Additionally, since you cannot rely on any strength beyond the ultimate strength, it is often not shown on the curve."

    "I haven't mentioned this prior to now but most curves just show the response to a sample being placed in tension (the notable exception being concrete).  The reason for this is that there are established relationships between the strength of a material in tension, and other failure modes.  In this way a single value, like the $58 ksi$ ultimate tensions strength of A36 steel, can be converted into $43.5 ksi$ ultimate shear strength.  These relationships vary from one material to the next based on the internal structure of the material, but a simple conversion factor is almost always available.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an additional wrinkle when we look at compression, due to the possibility of either local or global buckling.  Though if buckling does not occur then the statement I made about a simple conversion factor holds true.  It should also be noted that both shear and bending cause compression in an element, and so both of these can result in local buckling.  This must be accounted for with a series of rather complicated equations that vary depending on the size and shape of the element that you are using.  We won't be looking at those equations now; they're for another class.\n",

    "Steel will fail if it is subjected to excessive tension, shear, compression, or torsion.  However, the loads at which failure will occur are dependent upon other considerations, like the duration of the load, the temperature of the material, electrical activity in the material, and the chemistry of the surrounding environment. If the wrong type of steel is used in a caustic environment, it will begin to dissolve, and thereby reduce the cross section available to resist the applied load.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<a href = \"https://www.finedininglovers.com/blog/out-of-the-blue/art-liquid-nitrogen-flowers/\"><img src=\"http://finedininglovers.cdn.crosscast-system.com/BlogPost/l_2801_flowers--1-.jpg\" alt = \"Image of shattered flower\" Title=\"Shattered Flower\" style=\"max-width:200px; max-height:200px; border:1px solid blue; float:right; margin-left:10px;\"/></a>Load duration having an effect is something that might be a surprise to you. The reason is that the longer a load is applied the greater the likelihood that small defects will grow in response to the additional stress, and eventually lead to a failure.  In other words, the longer a load remains on a structure, the more time the atoms in the material have rearrange in response.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If that isn't clear think about it this way; when atoms are cold they move more slowly.  It is like time is passes more slowly for them.  Now imagine that a fresh flower is laying on a table.  If you place a weight on it, like a hammer, it will flatten.  Since the flower is at room temperature, it is the same as having a load applied over a long period of time.  Now if that same flower were frozen solid, just laying the hammer down on it wouldn't do much.  Since the atoms are moving more slowly, the flower behaves like time is moving more slowly.  To the frozen flower the weight of the hammer is now just a short term load.  In order to crush the frozen flower, the hammer has to smash down on it with much greater force.  This translates to the flower being able to resist greater shorter duration loads than long duration loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is actually a valid analogy, and this property of atoms moving more slowly when they're cold is used in [elastomeric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastomer) research."

An oxidizer is any substance that will remove electrons in a chemical reaction from the substance that is being oxidized.  This is actually really useful to know since it means that the corrosion of steel is actually an electrical reaction. This means it can be prevented with the proper application of electricity.  Some bridges and buildings are protected from corrosion simply by applying a low level current to the steel in the structure.  The way it works is that the electrons required by the chemistry are supplied by a power cord instead from the corroding steel.  \n",

Anodes made of zinc or other sacrificial are installed and periodically replaced.  As long as the zinc is electrically connected to steel, it will corrode first instead of the steel.  The while the zinc is corroding it supplies electrons to the oxidation reaction, preventing a chemical reaction with the steel from taking place.  This will continue as long as there is enough zinc to provide the needed electrons.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to prevent the corrosion of steel is to just protect it from the source of corrosion.  This could mean painting it, to seal it from the air, but is could also mean just keeping it dry.  In order for for the chemical reaction that causes rusting to occur (steel corroding) there must be a medium for ions to travel in.  In practice this medium is generally water.  Which means, if you keep steel dry, it generally won't corrode.\n",

However, due to not being pure iron, steel will melt around  $2,000 - 2,400 F^{\\circ}$, depending on its carbon content.  It will also begin to have reduced structural capacity at $1,000 - 1,300 F^{\\circ}$.  At this temperature the yield stress will only be about 60% of normal.  For this reason, critical elements of a structure need to be protected from fire exposure.  Those elements include beams and trusses that support floors, or critical columns in tall structures.  If there is a prolonged fire in a steel high-rise, and the collapse of the building will be due to the softening of the steel, not the steel actually burning.  The decision to fireproof a steel element, depends on the importance of the element, as defined in the building code.  I should point out though for high-rise structures made out of steel, most elements are important, and will be protected with some kind of insulation.  Concrete is often, but not always, used to fill this role, (it is relatively cheap but can be too heavy to be economically viable).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the other extreme, there is a lower temperature limit where steel can become too brittle.  For instance QT-100 (or A514) steel has a recommended lower limit of $-50 ^\\circ F$ for its safe use.  Below that it becomes brittle instead of ductile, and can be subject to failure without warning.  FYI unlike the relationship between yield and designation with A36 steel, A514 steel does not have a yield strength of $514 ksi$ but rather $100 ksi$.  Steel's designation generally does not indicate the yield strength of the material.  "

Depending on the size of the steel involved, you may also need access to a crane.  A relatively small beam like the 10 ft long W12x22 I mentioned previously weighs 220 lbs; at 20 ft in length it would be 440 lbs.  The physical dimensions of the be would be only 12.25\" in height (h), 4\" in width (w), less than 0.5\" in flange thickness (t), and about 0.25\" in web thickness (b).  This would seem to be fairly small and relative to a lot of beams it is.  W44x335 beams are available which stand 44\" tall (almost 4 ft) and weight 335 lbs for every foot of length.  Either way it should be clear that for a lot of usable sizes steel sections are practically impossible to move by hand.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you are using smaller pieces, using custom sizes, or needing stronger connections (which happens frequently) you would need other tools like cutting torches and welding machines.  A cutting torch uses hot gases to melt or burn away metal.  Other versions of cutting tools include automated saws and plasma torches.  A welding machine uses electricity to melt some filler metal, and the two pieces that are needing to be joined.  The resulting connection, if done correctly, is stronger than the original two pieces.  The filler metal will vary based on what types of metal that need to be connected, and the equipment can become expensive.  However, if you are using a crane to place steel, expensive does not mean the same thing as when you are just helping your buddy build something."

The investigation into the bridge collapse revealed that it was a single element's failure in the structure that started the chain reaction.  The undersized [gusset plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gusset_plate), which had been working for 40 years, finally gave out.  These plates which should have been 1 inch thick, were specified to be only half of that.  The mode of failure that the gusset plates under went was a type of buckling.  Buckling strength is approximately proportional to the thickness in the direction of bending raise to the third power, so having half the thickness meant that the gusset plate only had an eighth of the expected resistance to buckling."
