    "Wood being a natural material is not toxic when it is first milled, and unless it is treated with a toxin, it remains that way.  Why would wood be treated with a toxin?  The treatment of wood is generally done for one of two reasons.  The first reason. and one most common in Florida, is for insect, and rot resistance.  This is also referred to as pressure treating, though, technically, most chemical treatment of wood is done via pressurization.  The chemicals currently being used for rot resistance are based on copper compounds.  These are believed to be least dangerous for the environment.  In the past much more toxic chemicals like [arsenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Arsenic), and [creosote](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Creosote) were used.  Creosote is actually a well known carcinogen, and arsenic is a deadly poison.  However, these chemicals were highly effective as preservatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second reason wood is likely to be treated is for fire resistance.  This is not as common as it once was due to previous versions of fire treatment actually weakening the wood over time by chemically attacking it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Other coating, such as lead paint, can cause wood to become toxic, but again, if no toxic chemicals are added, wood is inherently nontoxic to the environment.  It should be noted that there are some species of wood that do contain natural toxins that affect some people.  Species like some varieties of cypress, mahogany, and oak contain toxins though the vast majority of lumber used in the construction industry has low, or no toxic effects.\n",

It is more green though if wood can be reused. Lumber can easily be reused if it has not been damaged.  Even damaged parts can be cut out of larger pieces leaving the smaller parts available for reuse.  There is actually even a rather healthy market for older lumber being reused.  Particularly if it is cut down and resurfaced.  Since wood is a natural material and some species of trees are no longer available, rare lumber is highly sought after.  If a board made out of rare wood can be reclaimed, it can often be sold for three times more than its modern equivalent, or even higher."

There are a few less common methods that involve heating the water in the lumber with a high frequency electric field or lowering the boiling temperature with the use of an applied vacuum but all artificial methods involve using energy to remove the water.  The gain is a reduced drying time and greater control over the drying rate.  Because of this most commercially available lumber is kiln dried.\n",
    "\n",
    "The air drying process, also known as seasoning, only requires keeping the lumber from getting wet.  Again the lumber is stacked with room for air to circulate but no forced circulation occurs.  Because of this air drying costs less to accomplish but since the main ingredient in this process is time it requires a greater storage space to match the volume of output of artificial drying.  Though drying times will vary based on temperature, relative humidity, initial moisture content and desired MC, the rule of thumb is for every one inch of lumber thickness an additional year of drying time is required.\n"

    "Wood is an anisotropic material; it has different properties depending on the direction it is tested in.

In the timber code this is accounted for by having different allowable stresses based on the type of loading an element is expected to experience.\n",

This would be very difficult to remember if it were not for the well laid out tables in the [timber code](http://www.awc.org/codes-standards/publications/nds-2015).  In my opinion the timber code is the simplest, and clearest written material code, but I may be biased by my fondness of wood and experiences working as a carpenter.  There is one additional item of note, it is the only material code that is free for on-line viewing that I'm aware of.  The state and International Building Codes are available on-line for free, but they often stop short of providing information about material design, and instead simply reference the relevant documents that need to be purchased separately.\n",

For steel we have a modulus of elasticity of 29,000 ksi, aluminum has a value of 10,000 ksi, and a piece of Southern Pine with a grade of Dense Select Structural has a modulus of elasticity of 1,900 ksi.  Since wood is a natural material the modulus of elasticity will vary base on both the grade and species.  For instance, a piece of Northern White Cedar, with a grade of \"No. 3\", has a modulus of elasticity of 600 ksi, while the Select Structural grade is 800 ksi.\n",
    "\n",
    "There actually further modifications that come into play when looking at the elastic modulus for wood.  Like with metal, the temperature effects the elastic modulus, but moisture also plays a role.  There is another modification that comes into play, if the wood was pressure treated using an injection technique.  This seems complicated, and it gets even more complicated if we start looking at allowable tension stress, or even bending, but again the code is actually quite easy to follow, and the modifications to the capacities are simple to apply.  Furthermore, the reason wood is such a common building material is that it is relatively easy to work with, and can be less expensive than other material.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets get back to the strength example.  If we have a Southern Pine 2x4 as part of the inside of a building, with a grade of \"No. 2\" (which is very common for structural design) loaded in tension, it would have a capacity of 675 psi.  Note that is *psi* and not ksi.  That means it could carry a maximum load of 3,540 lbs.  This may be less than you would expect.  Since size designations of lumber are not the same as actual lumber sizes, a 2x4 is not 2\"x4\", but rather 1.5\"x3.5\".  If this load was carried by a piece of A36 steel, it could be less than 0.5\"x0.5\".  However, you would need to use welding equipment to connect such a small member."

    "Wood should only be used in temperatures below 150 $^\\circ F$, and needs to have special consideration if used in temperatures above 100 $^\\circ F$.  Since wood is combustible, it must be protected from heat above its ignition temperature.  As the code has changed due to better understanding of potential risks, elements of building design have also changed.  One example of additional protection being added is that modern chimneys are required to be lined with incombustible material.  This step was not previously required in wood structures.  Hot gasses that escaped from leaking chimneys have been responsible for the destruction of many buildings, and now retrofitting of liners in older buildings during renovations is a requirement in some municipalities.  That being said, wood can actually be used as part of a fire rated assembly if it is designed for it.  This is because as wood burns it builds up a layer of charcoal that serves to insulate the material below the surface.  As long at the fire can be extinguished withing the rated time limit, the structural capacity of the wood element will still be sufficient."

    "If you are purchasing almost any quantity of lumber for a professional construction project, you will need to purchase it from a supplier that deals directly will a sawmill.  For locally grown species, you may be able to purchase directly from a smaller mill.  Either way, you are likely not to be able to find the grades you are looking for at the home supply store, without ordering ahead of time.  It is possible that you could purchase some grades of structural panels from there, but you would probably have to go in person to verify the grades and quality available."

You could use as little as a hand saw, a hammer, and some nails to complete a small project.  However, for a real construction project, there will likely be a couple types of circular saws, air powered nail guns, and even cranes if it's necessary to set [trusses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truss).  For panel material, there will likely be a need to use a [chalk box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalk_line).  Overall once you are familiar with the tools, the installation process is quick and easy to master."

    "There aren't many famous wood structural failures.  This is not to say that there aren't many failures of wooden structures.  It's just that due to the size limitations of wooden structures, the failures are not particularly spectacular.  One of the more common types of wood structural failures has less to do with the material, and more to do with the construction process, truss collapse.  These collapses generally have to do with inadequate bracing, and typically take place before the structure is finished.\n",
